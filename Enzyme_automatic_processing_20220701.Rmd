#WHAT DOES THIS FILE DO?
This file is meant to automate outputs from enzymes analyses and convert fluorescence to nmol/gdrysoil/hr
This R Markdown automates the enzymes data processing using the following steps: 
1) using MUB/MUC standard plates, generate the 12 standard curves for each sample ID and export list of ID, slope, intercept and R2 values
2) import and combine MUB/MUC standard curves into one dataset and plot R2 values for QA/QC purposes
3) import and use standard curves to calculate fluorescence readings for all sample x enzyme plates, convert to nmol/gram dry soil, and combine the results for export


#GETTING STARTED:
create a set of folders for
  1) MUB/MUC labeled standard plates (labeling instructions below)
  2) output folder for MUB/MUC standard curve calculations
  3) Dry weights of soil samples
  4) labelled sample plates (instructions below)
  5) output of labeled sample plates.
  6) output of combined and averaged file


#FORMATTING MUB/MUC STANDARD PLATES   
THE MUB and MUC standards can be saved as a XLSX or CSV with format:
std|ID1|ID2|ID3|ID4|ID5|ID6|ID7|ID8|ID9|ID10|ID11|ID12|gain|substrate
std = standard concentration in ppm (ex. 0, 0.5, 5, 10, 25)
ID1:12 (here used PEA1-12 is ID number for 12 samples) values in the cells below the header are fluorescence readings from the plate
gain: gain read for each MUB/MUC plate
substrate: whether the plate is MUB/MUC <- this one is particularly important. :)


##STEP 1: IMPORT AND CREATE STANDARD CURVES FROM MUB/MUC PLATES 
You will have to change the following to generalize this code for your purposes:
  line 49 and 54: select input directory (see point 1 in list of folders above)
  line 69: change sample ID to gather the dataset by
  line 104: (optional) select separate output folder for enzymes files (point 2 above)
```{r standards}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("openxlsx")
#install.packages("readxl")
library(tidyverse)
library(openxlsx)
library(readxl)

#set working directory to file where standard plates (relabeled) are stored (folder 1 in getting started section); read in list of all files in the folder
setwd("~/Desktop/enzymes_2022/baseline_2022/standard_plates/import") 
standards <- list.files()

#this code will loop through all files and create standard curves for each of the samples in a plate (12 curves per MUB/MUC standard plate) and store them in a dataframe for export. 
for (a in standards) {
setwd("~/Desktop/enzymes_2022/baseline_2022/standard_plates/import")  
#import file using correct import statement
  if (grepl(".xlsx", a) == T){  
    standards <- read_excel(a)
  } else if (grepl(".csv", a) == T) {
    standards <- read.csv(a)
  } else {
    cat("Something went wrong reading file ", a, " Is it a csv or xlsx? If xlsx, make sure file is not open")
    stop()
  }

#convert ppm standards to umol values, which we will use for standard curves
  standards$umol<-standards$std*.0002
  
#make standards long form, gathering by ID1-ID12 (this line may need tweaking for generalization) and creating a reading column with reading value for each unique ID and standard case
  standard <- gather(standards, ID, reading, PEA1:PEA12, factor_key=TRUE)
  curve <- standard %>% select(umol | ID |reading |substrate ) %>% na.omit()  #just standards 
  
#split long form dataset into 12 datasets: one dataframe for each sample ID. This allows us to calculate standard curves separately. Also, create empty dataframe to save lm results for each sample.
  data_list <- split(curve, f = curve$ID)                 
  savetest <- data.frame(ID = rep(NA, 11), int = rep(NA, 11), slope = rep(NA, 11), r2 = rep(NA, 11))

#perform a regression on each sample dataframe in the list (you can check R2 values in rows 8 and 9)
for(i in 1:length(data_list)){
    savetest[[i]]=summary(lm(reading~umol,data=data_list[[i]])) 
}        

#create slope and intercept lists
int <- data.frame(interecept= rep(NA, 1))     # Creating data containing NA
slope <- data.frame(slope = rep(NA, 1))     # Creating data containing NA

#populate slope and intercept lists from lms for each sample type in the list
for(i in 1:length(data_list)){
    int[[i]]=as.numeric(coef(summary(lm(reading~umol,data=data_list[[i]])))[1]) 
    slope[[i]]=as.numeric(coef(summary(lm(reading~umol,data=data_list[[i]])))[2]) 
} 

#save list of ID and lm values needed  (r2, int, slope) in an empty dataframe that we will popualate with the results
library(dplyr)
curve_list<-data.frame(ID = rep(NA, 12), int = rep(NA, 12), slope = rep(NA, 12)) 
curve_list$ID<-unique(curve$ID) #add in ID from initial dataframe
  curve_list<-cbind(curve_list, t(savetest[8,])) #bind r2 values
  names(curve_list)[names(curve_list) == '8'] <- 'R2' #rename r2 r2 :) 
  curve_list$int <- cbind(as.numeric(int))   #pulls out intercept from regression
  curve_list$slope <- cbind(as.numeric(slope))  
  curve_list$substrate=unique(curve$substrate)
  curve_list$gain=unique(curve$gain)
  rownames(curve_list)<-NULL

#write to export in new folder :) if you want XLSX you can use the commented line below
setwd("~/Desktop/enzymes_2022/baseline_2022/standard_plates/standard_curves") 
save_name <- sub(".csv", "", a) #remove .csv from file name
  #save_name <- sub(".xlsx", "", save_name) #remove .xlsx from file name
  write.xlsx(curve_list, paste0(save_name, "_stds.xlsx"))
  
}
```





##STEP 2: CALCULATE SAMPLE VALUES
You now have a file for each standard plate that includes the 12 standard curves in the format ID|int|slope|R2|substrate.
This chunk imports your standards and combines them in one dataframe, then plots r2 values

TO DO BEFORE RUNNING: 
-Line 124 (optional) select separate output folder for enzymes files (point 2 above)
```{r importstd}
#import and bind standard files in a single dataframe
setwd("~/Desktop/enzymes_2022/baseline_2022/standard_plates/standard_curves/csv") 
file_names <- dir("~/Desktop/enzymes_2022/baseline_2022/standard_plates/standard_curves/csv") 
std_curves <- do.call(rbind,lapply(file_names,read.csv))

#plot r2 values and check quality; color by MUB standard or MUC standard
library(ggplot2)
r2plot<-ggplot(data = std_curves) +
  aes(x = ID, y = R2, color=substrate) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=.98, linetype="dashed", 
                color = "red")+
  geom_jitter()+
  theme_classic()
r2plot
```




#CALCULATE SAMPLE VALUES------------------------------------------------------------------------;
This next chunk imports sample tray fluorescence readings and calculates nmol/gdrysoil/


#SAMPLE PLATE FORMAT
Sample plates format as: enzyme|ID1:12|gain|substrate
  enzyme: contains which enzyme substrate (e.g., XYL, PHOS, AG) was added to the row
  ID1:12 contains ID at the top and fluorescence readings below
   ****ID should ideally be formatted as [projectcode][number][A-C], so example PEA1A or PEA12C. Not following this technique might cause sorting problems later on... 
  gain: gain reading for that plate file
  substrate: which standard substrate (MUB/MUC) is associated with the gain
  
  
#SOIL/SEDIMENT WEIGHT FORMAT
This chunk also imports sample weights, a simple list of ID|weight_g; 
***KKS: I may later change this to ID | wc_frac |weight_g |dry_weight_gr... but for now I have to retrieve the sample weight values from the lab so this is all tester anyway. 


#THINGS YOU NEED TO DO (prior to running this chunk)
  Line 172 change weight location and file name to match  your files (point 3 in start section)
  Line 176 & 180: change location to where your sample plates are located (point 4 in start section)
  Line 192: change "PEA" to your sample ID code
  Line 229: change output folder destination (point 5 in start section)
```{r importsamps}
